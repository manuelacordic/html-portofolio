# html-portofolio
This is my first Web Developer Portfolio project built entirely with HTML. The website showcases my work, including the Movie Ranking Project and Birthday Invite Project, as well as my personal information and contact details. The portfolio includes screenshots of each project as preview images linked to the respective project pages, and has About Me and Contact Me sections to personalize the website.

The project demonstrates my ability to create structured, semantic HTML websites and organizes content efficiently using headings, lists, links, and footer elements. It serves as a portfolio piece to highlight my skills and previous work.

The portfolio is published on GitHub Pages and can be shared with potential employers, clients, or anyone interested in viewing my projects.
